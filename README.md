### Project Description:
Using jQuery, AJAX, and JSON to interface with the TMDB API, we will build a web application that takes in users

relevant data from the database, and AJAX and jQuery to modify the page data as queries are made.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. How to use key value pairs in data gathered from an API to populate needed fields on a web page.
2. How to work with API's by passing along queries to the database then interperting the results and using them in the application.
3. Good naming conventions to make application programming easier to read when coming back to it after a few days.
   (i.e. naming ID's after the first have of the key value pairs)
